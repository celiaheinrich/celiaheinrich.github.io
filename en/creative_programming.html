    <p>A space for a program which puts into application what I have learnt in a <i>creative programming</i> course. This will be a mini-game developed with <i>html5 and javascript</i> and which hero, as you may have guessed, is a little plush monster.<br>The application is being developed. Its animations are quite simple.  And I will have to get myself to <i>Audacity</i> for the sound part: this is completely new for me.</p>
    
    <p>Before starting a months-long project, I made a little demo to try out all functions (besides storywriting and game design) required for creating a game from scratch (developer, graphic designer, sound designer, etc.). 
    <br>
    The gameplay is basic and doesn't reflect the intended game's. Only the universe was kept. You must help the little monster gather all the components to repair itself.
