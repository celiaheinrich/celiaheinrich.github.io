    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p class="citation"><i>While they were preparing the hemlock, Socrates was learning how to play a new tune on the flute. "What will be the use of that?" he was asked. "To know this tune before dying."</i> 1966, Émile Cioran.</p>
    <p>This anecdote from Socrates' life perfectly sums up my opinion on learning. Learning in an end in itself. One doesn't need years of practice to justify investing in a new cursus.
    <br> I like very different things, from computer science to literature, or astronomy, mythology and baking. And even though I am self-taught in some fields, I'm also taking several taught courses. Some time ago, I also took on <b>MOOC</b> (Massive Open Online Courses). I'm registered on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and take part in courses and lectures that cover my interests.
    <br><br>
    Below is a list of courses I have taken to date.
