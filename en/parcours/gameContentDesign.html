    <h2>Game Content Design</h2>
    <p> My first experience in video games. At F4, I had a double position of <b>Game Content Designer</b> and <b>Tool Developer</b>. I took part in two MMORPG productions: <i>Exalight</i> and, mostly, <a href="https://www.empireofsports.com/fr/index.html"><i>Empire of Sports</i></a>.
    <br><br>The mission of a Game Content Designer consists in offering and creating contents which are progressively added to the game. Unlike a classic game, an MMORPG constantly needs new material to keep players interested, and must continuously offer new missions and fresh experiences.
     <div class="ensemble-formation">
        <h3>Mission of a Game Content Designer:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Conceive new concepts coherent with the game universe and spirit.</li>
            <li>Create characters with unique personalilties to interact with the player.</li>
            <li>Create different equipments and objects following the Game Design while keeping a balanced game.</li>
            <li>Design the missions that players need to complete to progress in the adventure.</li>
            <li>Write all in-game dialogs and text.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <br>As the name says, <a href="https://www.empireofsports.com/fr/index.html"><i>Empire of Sports</i></a>  is a sports game. There are six disciplines: football, basketball, tennis, bobsleigh, ski, track and field. All offer players to compete in both single and team events. The game also contains several cities where they can meet, form clubs and experience the RPG aspect of the game which rarely comes with sport simulation games.
    <br>The player must train his avatar, monitor its health, make him compete in the various seasonal events to earn rewards (in-game or real life).
    <br><br>
    Here is a gallery of some non-sport events (taking place in the cities) that I designed.
