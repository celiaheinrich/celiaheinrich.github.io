    <h2>Game Building</h2>
    <p>My second experience in the video game sector, at <a href="http://www.quanticdream.com/fr">Quantic Dream</a>. This was in the context of their fourth game, a AAA production on PS3: <a href="http://beyondps3.com/eu-au-nz">Beyond: Two Souls</a>.
    <br><br>
    The game building consists in putting together the different elements of a game (objects, characters, animations, dialogues) and to script the player's interactions with all these elements, as well as the AI of the non-playable characters.
    </p>
    
    <div class="ensemble-formation">
        <h3>Mission of the Game Builder:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Put together the game elements, consistently with the game design.</li>
            <li>Script up all available interactions in each game level.</li>
            <li>Create the animated sequences, integrate sound and dialogs.</li>
            <li>Script NPCs' artificial intelligence.</li>
            <li>Ensure all elements remain consistent in each level.</li>
        </ul>
