    <h2>Other experiences</h2>
    <p>Before branching to video games, I had the opportunity to work in various companies, and in very different positions.
    <br>Some of my previous jobs were in a bank, a major TV channel, an electricity company, and in the French Army. I worked in large companies, to familiarise with the intricacies of bureaucracy, its ups and downs, and to put them in perspective with the characteristics of small video game studios.
    <br>I like to think that, thanks to these organisations, I have built for myself a solid base of best practices to follow and dangers to avoid.
    <br><br>
    Below, some of my experiences which helped me consolidate my knowledge base.
