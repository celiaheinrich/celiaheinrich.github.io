    <p>An erotic short story I wrote for a contest organised by <a href="http://www.edilivre.com/">Edilivre</a>. I had stumbled upon it completely by chance and, to be honest, I didn't know much about the genre as the only book of the category on my bookshelf was <i>The misfortunes of Virtue</i>, by Sade. So I read quite a few before throwing myself into it: a novel full of clichés, some dodgy things as well… In the end, I took away that most erotic stories are based on encounters, on novelty: this little tingling feeling and the butterflies in the stomach (or somewhere else) one feels from a handsome stranger. I thus wanted to do the exact opposite, and have eroticism lie in the routine of lovers who know each other by heart.</p>
