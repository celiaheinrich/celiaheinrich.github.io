    <ul class="caracteristiques-ecrit">
        <li><u>Type:</u> short story</li>

        <li><u>Number of characters:</u> ~ 7000 (including spaces)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As I thought I was writing for a contest, I slightly misunderstood the indications. Let me explain. In France, it is the number of characters, including spaces, which are counter, whereas English texts are sized on words. I thus produced a writing which was way shorter than expected. Later I submitted it to another contest.<br>
<i>La dévoreuse d'âmes</i>  (The Soul Eater) is a fantasy short story, a romance to be accurate. This genre doesn't really have any equivalent in France. To sum up, most are happy ending stories, revolving around a couple. "Happily ever after". In this case, since I'm no fan of the genre and that it's a short text, it won't end as nicely.<br>
