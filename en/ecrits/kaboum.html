    <p>A sci-fi short story I had submitted for the contest organised by <a href="http://www.geekopolis.fr/index.php/">Geekopolis</a> and <a href="http://cms.presences-d-esprits.com/index.php">Club Présence d'esprits</a>. It managed to reach the final round, but did not win. The ending was deemed too brutal. I have since then modified and resubmitted it, after a suggestion from the jury of <a href="http://cms.presences-d-esprits.com/index.php">Club Présence d'esprits</a>, AOC.
<i>Kaboum!</i> narrates the life of Doress in a futuristic universe where the notion of privacy belongs to a past long gone. In an Orwellian context, people are continuously aware of what their neighbours live, think and feel. But on that day, everything is about to change for Doress.<br>
Due to my background (in computer science) and my interests, I have always been concerned by issues related to data protection and privacy. This short story was the opportunity to discuss this topic in the context of a dystopia.</p>
