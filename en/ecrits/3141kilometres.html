    <p>My first novel. A road-trip which narrates Max and his friends' adventures on the quest for meaning. Booze, drugs and fun. In short, life! The story is narrated from Max's point of view. The style is diary-like, mostly spoken and thus easy to read. Maybe a little too much.<br>
    A first take on writing. My style has evolved quite a bit since then. I will likely take it up again later.</p>
