    <p>A steam punk short story written for a literary challenge, twenty-four hours to write a short story which had to satisfy some constraints.<br>
I had good fun taking it on, even though I felt uncomfortable with the 18,000-character limit. I had to speed up the ending. I had more than enough material to go on!<br>
Rodolphe is a genius inventor, or close to being one… He's just had a great new idea to present to the Inventorium, the yearly congress of inventors…</p>
