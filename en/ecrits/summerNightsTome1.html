    <p>First tome of my series on vampires.
This novel was written for a contest of novice writers with a young adult audience. It is a bit-lit novel, meaning most of the characters are vampires.<br>
Like, I'm guessing, every adult who was a teenager in the 90s, I was really influenced by Anne Rice's novels and Joss Whedon's series <i>Buffy the vampire slayer</i>. The walls of my bedroom were covered with David Boreanaz and James Marsters posters. On my door hung proudly an <i>Interview with a vampire</i> poster.
<br>As for the new generation of bit-lit novels, I have to admit that <i>Twilight</i> definitely bores me. 
But I was pleasantly surprised by Lindqvist work: <i>Let me in</i>. It has a particularly dark point of view.
