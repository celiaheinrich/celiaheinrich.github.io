  <p>This website is first of all a portfolio, a gallery of various projects, both professional and personal. It isn't meant to be comprehensive, for copyright or relevance reasons, but I hope these elements will give you a precise idea of my area of expertise, my experiences and affinities.
  <br>Its content isn't written in stone. This site will evolve and follow the flow of my projects. So don't hesitate to come back regularly!
