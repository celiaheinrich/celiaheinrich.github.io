    <p>What one should remember <i>about me</i> is: be it about work or personal interests, there are endlessly many things I'm interested in and in which I invest my time.
    <br>
    I have a Masters in Computer Science applied to Management and I work in the video game industry, mainly in creative positions (game content design, level design, etc.). I thus have a solid scientific background: I'm organised, methodical, pragmatic. A true Cartesian! And in parallel, I love creating stories, characters, games, bringing them to life while keeping a keen eye on each detail.
    <br>
    Cheese or dessert? Why choose? I like jumping from one branch to the next on the tree of possibilities; to not restrain myself to one and only subject to which I'd have to stick at all cost. When people say specialisation, I think versatility. I love learning and acquiring new knowledge. This is something I'm naturally gifted at and that I continuously strive to develop.
