        <p>Lara Croft, a strong woman from video games. I like the paradoxical image of this character: both feminist and sexy as hell. Over time, she has lost part of a her surrealistic figure. Maybe she is the one who is trying to look like me. Keep up, Lara! Three, maybe four cup sizes left, and you're good!</p>
